    <p>This is Sticky, a minor character from the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_and_PuppyCat">Bee and Puppycat</a>, created by the talented people at
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederator_Studios">Frederator</a>. She's
        a yellow dog, and the pet of another character in the show. Like almost all animation, the character's not made
        by a single artist, it's brought to life by a team of animators, storyboard artists, writers, and other
        miscellaneous jobs.
